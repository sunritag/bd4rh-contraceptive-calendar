## Data

```{r}
mali <- readRDS("DHS_data/Mali/Mali_final.RDS")
mali <- mali %>%
  select(c(abortion, conception, start, start_modern, start_trad, 
           start_short, start_long, shortLong_switch, longShort_switch, 
           modTrad_switch, tradMod_switch, discontinuation, time, Year, 
           exposed_15, v001, deaths, foreign_aid, v501, v013, v025, v149, 
           v190, cluster_unique)) %>%
  mutate(time = fct_relevel(time, ref = "During"))
```

TODO:
- append the wave of survey to cluster variable in join data file in order to uniquely identify the cluster based on wave
- only interpret time exposed
- make all time coefficients relative to the during period
- for nigeria, have year*exposed_15 instead of time*exposed_15
- save and export each model output as csv in github, then group them by country
- put together table of estimates for just the interaction terms 
- make a line graph showing coefficient for each time period - marginal effects (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/margins/vignettes/Introduction.html)
  - add confidence intervals on graph
  - for nigeria, x is year, baseline is first year 
  - for mali and zimbabwe, time is x and have one value for exposed and unexposed
