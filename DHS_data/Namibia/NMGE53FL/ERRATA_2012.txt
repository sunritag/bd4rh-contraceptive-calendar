Dear DHS GPS Data User,

We are contacting you because you downloaded a previous version of the Namibia 2006 DHS GPS data.  
The dataset NMGE51FL had 2 clusters with incorrect urban/rural definitions and 55 clusters with 
missing urban/rural definitions.   


The following cluster's urban_rural values have been changed from rural to urban: 338, 339

Clusters 183-238 now have urban/rural definitions.


These issues have been resolved in the newly issued dataset NMGE52FL.  Please use these data 
for any analyses and disregard the previous data file.  We apologize for any confusion this may 
cause you.
