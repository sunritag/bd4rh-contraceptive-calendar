Dear DHS GPS Data User,

We are contacting you because you downloaded a previous version of the Namibia 2006 DHS GPS data.  
The dataset NMGE52FL had 9 clusters with incorrect DHSID fields, all other fields were correct.
These 9 rows all had field name NM200600000500 instead of the DHSID that corresponded to the individual DHSCLUST.
This applies to DHSCLUST 150, 151, 184, 185, 227, 368, 414, 475, and 479.    



These issues have been resolved in the newly issued dataset NMGE53FL.  Please use these data 
for any analyses and disregard the previous data file.  We apologize for any confusion this may 
cause you.
