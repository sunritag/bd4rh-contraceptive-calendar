Notes on Recode File

1.  V014, B10, SH103F - The flags for the date of birth of the respondent,
    her children and her husband contain an additional code 7 meaning that
    the year of birth and age are both stated, but month of birth was not
    given, and year of birth plus age equalled 88 (the year of interview).
    For these dates the year of birth was ignored in the imputation
    process and the final imputed year of birth may be different from the
    original reported year of birth.  See the note on date imputation.

2.  V106-V107, V133, S110-S111 & V701-V702, V715, S703-S704 - The
    education system in Ghana does not follow the standard education
    pattern found in many DHS surveys.  Students who complete Primary
    school go on to Middle school for two to four years.  After Middle
    school students may go to a Post-Middle school for a number of years,
    usually two or four, before going to Secondary school or they may go
    directly to Secondary school.

    Variables S110-S111 and S703-S704 record the highest education level
    and grade for the respondent and her partner as reported in the
    interview.  V106-V107, V133 and V701-V702, V715 contain standard
    variables for use in comparative analyses.

3.  V312, SH211 - For the current contraceptive method, Foaming Tablets
    are treated as a separate category from code 4 (Diaphragm/Jelly)
    although they are grouped together in the contraceptive knowledge and
    use tables (V304-V307 and SH202-SH205).

4.  V314 - There is an additional response code 6 meaning that no specific
    system was used for periodic abstinence.

5.  V323 - An additional code 96 was used if the respondent was not able
    to name the pill brand used.

6.  REC97 - An employment module was used to collect information about a
    respondent's working life, including details of her current work, her
    work before she was first married and a history of work between the
    births of her children.  The history of births contains up to four
    entries.  The first entry relates to the period since the respondent's
    last birth, the second entry is for the period before the first birth,
    the third relates to the interval before the last birth but after the
    penultimate birth and the fourth is for the interval between the
    penultimate birth and the birth preceding that.

    The index variable IDX97 points to the interval to which the entry
    pertains.  If IDX97 is 0 the entry is for the interval since the last
    birth.  If IDX97 is any value other than 0 then the entry is for the
    interval prior to that birth in the birth history (REC21).  Using the
    example in the Description of the DHS Individual Recode (page 11), the
    entries in the employment history may be as follows:

         IDX97 SWKA SWKBSWKBA SWKCSWKDHSWKDM SWKESWKFYSWKFM
             0    1   41    3    1    3    0    4    0    6
             7    1   60    4    3    0   15    6    2    0
             1    2
             3    1   41    3    2   95   95    6    1    6

    The first entry is for the interval since the last birth.  The second entry is for the interval prior to the first birth.
    This respondent has had seven births and so birth 7 in the birth history is the first birth.  The third entry is for the
    interval before the last birth (the first entry in the birth history).  This birth produced twins and so the interval is
    between births 1 and 3 in the birth history.  The fourth entry is for the interval between the next to last birth
    (birth 3) and the birth preceding that (birth 4).
7.  REC98 - The husbands questionnaire information has been matched with the women's data and all of the
    information has been appended to each case.  For husbands who are married to more than one interviewed woman
    the husbands information is matched to each wife.

    There are two variables added to the file SHWIVES and SHWIFE which relate to this matching process.
    SHWIVES indicates how many wives of the current husband were interviewed, and SHWIFE indicates which of
    these wives is the current one.  To analyze just the male data, counting husbands only once, select the cases where
    SHWIFE is 1.  To analyze husbands with their wives select all of the husbands.


Inconsistencies in the Data File

1.  B6 - There are 256 children for whom the age at death was recorded as one year and the interviewer did not probe
    further to find out the age at death in months.

2.  V310, V311 - There is one case in which the original response given was inconsistent with the number of children
    to whom the respondent had ever given birth.  This is recorded as code 97 on V310 and code 7 on V311.


Differences from previous version

1.     V710 (How earnings before marriage are shared) is no longer used, and S728 (Who decided how earnings before
       marriage are shared) has been added, replacing V710.Date imputation

In many cases the year of birth of the respondent, a child or her husband was calculated by the interviewer based on the
age reported when the date of birth was not known.  This calculation was incorrectly performed by subtracting the age
from 88 (the year of interview) to give the year of birth.  When the data were entered the month of birth is left unknown,
the year of birth and age are recorded.  The result is that the data are consistent, but the distribution of births imputed
according to the usual procedure is heavily biased towards the months before the survey, whereas if the month of birth was
given the year of birth and age are very close to the expected distribution.

The table below separates the respondents, their children and their husbands into two categories according to whether the
year of birth plus age sums to 88 (the year of interview) or 87 (the year before interview), implying that the birthday is in
one of the months before the interview or in one of the months after the interview respectively.  The table is broken down
according to whether the month of birth was stated.  The approximate distribution of births expected in the two categories
according to the date of the interview is also given.

       Percent Distribution of the Sum of Year of Birth and Age by Whether
       Month of Birth was Given for Respondents, Living Children and Husbands.

       Expected    30.0             70.0   30.0     70.0

Due to this problem a different imputation procedure was used.  The year of birth was ignored during the imputation
process for dates where the month of birth was not given and the year of birth plus age equalled 88.  This corrected the
problem of heaping of births in the early months of each year, although the final year of birth imputed is different from the
original year of birth recorded by the interviewer.  Dates where the year of birth was ignored in the imputation process are
recorded as code 7 in the relevant date flag variables.
