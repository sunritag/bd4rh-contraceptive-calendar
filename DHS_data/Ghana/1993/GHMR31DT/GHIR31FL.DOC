Notes on Recode File

1.   In Ghana, a three year period (0-35 months) was used to select
     children for the child health and anthropometry sections of the
     questionnaire, rather than a five year period (0-59 months), as in
     most other DHS 2 countries.  This affects the following sections and
     variables.

     All  variables in sections REC41 (maternity), REC42 (health and
     breastfeeding), REC43 (health) and REC44 (height and weight) are based
     on children born in the last three years.

     Variable V367 (whether respondent wanted her last child) is based on
     women who had a child in the last three years.

     The definition of an amenorrheic woman is slightly different to that
     used in other DHS 2 countries, because of the three year window.  For
     the Ghana recode file, a woman is considered to be amenorrheic if she
     has had a child in the last three years, and has not menstruated
     since.  For other DHS 2 countries, a woman is considered to be
     amenorrheic if she has had a child in the last five years, and has not
     menstruated since.  This definition affects variables V623 (exposure
     for unmet need), V624 (Unmet need), V625 (Exposure, definition 2) and
     V626 (Unmet need, definition 2).

2.   The eligible men base is all de facto males aged 15-59

3.   Ages 96 and over in the household schedule are coded as 97.

4.   The education system in Ghana does not follow the standard education
     pattern found in many DHS surveys.  Students who complete primary
     school go on to Middle school for two to four years.  After middle
     school students may go to a Post-Middle school for a number of years,
     usually two or four, before going to Secondary school, or they may go
     directly to Secondary school.

     Variables HV106, HV107, V106, V107, V701 and V702 contain standard
     categories for highest level and grade of education for the respondent
     and her partner.  For these variables, middle school has been
     regrouped into the category 'Primary'.  Variables HV108 and V108
     record the number of completed years of education, using the following
     assumptions about the maximum number of years required to complete
     each level.

          - primary      : 6
          - middle       : 2
          - secondary    : 5

     Variables S108, S109, S703 and S704 record the highest level and grade
     of education for the respondent as reported in the interview.
     Variables SH10LE and SH10FO record this information as reported in the
     interview for household members.

5.   There are two country specific categories for the water sources (HV201
     and HV202) :
          23 : Borehole
          35 : Dugout


6.   The base for the variables that record the time to get to the source
     for water is all respondents except those with water piped into the
     residence, yard or plot; those with a well in the residence; and those
     who give bottled water or rainwater as their water source.  The
     variables concerned are HV204 and V115.

7.   There is one country specific category for the toilet variable (HV205)
          42 : Bucket/pan.

     vehicle except a motor cycle.

9.   There is one country specific category for main material of floor
     (HV213) :
          36 : Terrazo.

10.  Literacy (V108).  In the questionnaire, those respondents who said
     that their highest level of education was secondary/higher were not
     asked the question about literacy, as they are assumed to read easily.
     For these respondents, the literacy variable is coded as 'reads
     easily'.  However, for those respondents whose highest education level
     was middle/JSS, the actual response to the literacy question was used.



11.  Religion.  The 11 categories in the questionnaire were recoded as
     follows

     1    Protestant (Anglican, Methodist, Presbyterian, Pentecostal)
     2    Catholic
     3    Other Christian (Spiritualist, Other Christian)
     4    Muslim
     5    Traditional
     6    Other
     0    No religion

     The original variables related to religion were kept as country
     specific.

12.  There was no category for Prolonged Abstinence in the original data
     file.  Norplant is included as a contraceptive method.

13.  For variable V376 (Main reason not to use a pill), the country
     specific category 'became pregnant while using' has been recoded as
     'Other'.  The original variable is been kept as S???
14.  For variable M14 (Number of antenatal visits), category 20 includes
     responses of 20 and higher.

15.  For variables V407 and V408 (Number of times child was breastfed
     during day and night), category 20 includes responses of 30 and
     higher.  The category 'on demand' (96) was not used in the
     questionnaire.

16.  For the variable V423, 'Amount of liquid used to prepare oral
     rehydration solution', where the respondent answered that she used a
     beer bottle to measure the liquid, the response was recoded to 750 ml.


17.  For variable V425, which contains information for the place where the
     respondent learnt to prepare the recommended home fluid for oral
     rehydration, the category 98, 'Don't know', is not used.

18.  The upper limit for duration of diarrhea (H11A) is 30 days.

19.  For the questions on source of prenatal care (M2), and source of
     delivery assistance (M3), there are separate codes for nurse and for
     midwife.  'Midwife' includes both principal and auxiliary midwife.
     The changed codes are as follows :

          - M2B/M2C : Nurse
          - M3B/M3C : Midwife

20.  The upper limit for duration of a child's cough (H31A) is 60 days.

21.  In Ghana, separate questions were used to get information about the
     source and type of treatment for a cough, and source and treatment for
     a fever.  These questions were asked if a respondent's child had a
     fever or cough in the last two weeks.

     The responses to these questions were recoded as variables H32, H37
     and H38 (treatment of fever/cough).  The responses for each category
     of source and treatment were combined as follows :

     Response            Recode value

     YES for either           YES
     DK  for either           DK
     MISSING for either       MISSING
     NO or NOTAPPL for both   NO

22.  Variable V510 contains the value of the flag for completeness of date
     of marriage information. Code 4 (Year and Age, Year ignored) has been
     added to the recode dictionary to reflect the imputation process used
     for Ghana DHS III.

23.  The upper limit for the number of times a respondent had sex in the
     last four weeks is 40.

24.  For variable V618, the category 'respondent wants another child'
     includes those cases originally coded as 'both partners want another
     child'.  The original variable with this category has been included as
     country specific variable S609.

25.  Variable V707 (type of land where husband works), is based on cases
     where V716 has the following codes :

     - 60 : Farm managers
     - 61 : Farmers
     - 62 : Farm workers
     - 63 : Livestock farm workers

26.  For variable V719, 'for whom the respondent works',  the category
     'works for someone else' includes those cases originally coded as
     'works for the government'.  The original variable with this category
     has been included as country specific variable S609.

27.  The variables for duration and months of amenorrhea, abstinence and
     breastfeeding all have an extra category, which is 'Don't know' (98).
     Variable V426, 'When child first put to breast', also has this extra
     category.

28.  Variable SH21 is based on all household members, and records the
     amount paid for medical supplies or advice received in the last 2
     weeks.  This variable is coded zero (0) if the member did not receive
     supplies or advice in the last 2 weeks, or received them at no cost.       Inconsistencies in the Data File

Corrections to Original Data

1.   There are 7 cases where the result code for the height and weight
     measurement was missing in the original data, but height and weight
     measurements were given.  For these cases, the result code has been
     corrected to 0, 'measured'.

Notes on Male Recode File

1.   There was one missing value for MV362, timing for intent to use a
     future method, for a respondent who was not currently using a method
     of family planning and who did not intend to use one in the future.
2.   Three interviews took three hours or more.
3.   Data for 69 women who were listed as wives in the menþs data were
     excluded from the womenþs individual recode file because they were
     ineligible for interview; the data for 24 additional women were
     excluded because their interviews were not completed.


Inconsistencies in the Male Data File

1.   There were two cases where the reported end of the interview occurred
     before the time it started.
2.   There are four cases in which the age at first sexual intercourse
     could not be imputed due to missing data.
3.   In two cases, the manþs wife or partner was reported as sterilized
     based on the contraceptive table, but the respondent was not currently
     using any method.  In one other case where the partner was sterilized,
     the respondent claimed to be currently using a diaphragm, foam, or
     jelly.
4.   Fifteen men were reported with different marital status in the
     household than they reported themselves.
5.   Three men reported having ever used female sterilization but did not
     indicate this as their current method.
6.   The years of education for three men imply that they started school
     before the age of 5.
