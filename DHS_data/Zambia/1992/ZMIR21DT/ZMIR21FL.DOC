1.   The regions used in Zambia were the provinces, for that reason
     provinces were not kept as country specific variables.

2.   The sample domain (HV023) is recoded according to: Urban
     areas, Luapula rural, North-west rural, Western rural, and
     Other rural.

3.   Codes 60 to 64 in the original occupation variables were
     recoded as agriculture self employed.  The reason for that is
     because there is no way to differentiate between self-employed
     or employee, using those codes.  Variables V707 and V718 can
     be used to make that differentiation.

4.   There are 17 women who got married or began living with a man
     before the age of 10.

5.   There are more than 200 cases of respondents working as a self
     employees (V718=3,4) and declared that they did not earn cash
     for that work (V720 =0)

6.   There are 3 households where there are no adults that are
     usual residents.

7.   Variable V131 "Ethnicity" was created out of question Q166 and
     was recoded into the same categories published in the final
     report.  However, the original question was also kept as
     country specific in S116.

Inconsistencies in the Data File

1.   There are 8 cases where the respondent did not answer the
     literacy question (V108), however later she declared that she
     reads newspapers or magazines once a week (V109).

2.   There are 37 dead children whose age at death was reported as
     one year when it was supposed to be reported in months.  In 2
     children the age at death was given in days when it was
     supposed to be given in months.  For 5 children whose age at
     death was reported in years there is a discrepancy between B6
     and B7 because B7 was adjusted to fit in the interval.

3.   There are 10 women currently using contraception but the
     method they are using is missing (V312=missing).  They were
     classified as currently using folkloric method in V313.

4.   There are 6 women who had used male sterilization, however
     they are currently using a different method or not using at
     all.  

5.   There are 21 cases of twins where any of the maternity
     variables (M1-M17) are not the same.

6.   There are 5 cases where there is an inconsistency between the
     duration of amenorrhea (M6, M7) and time since last menstrual
     period (V215).

7.   There are 23 cases where there is an inconsistency between the
     duration of abstinence (M8, M9) and time since last sexual
     intercourse (V527).

8.   There are 3 cases where there is an inconsistency between the
     duration of breastfeeding (M4) and the age at death (B7).

9.   There are 19 cases of children who had a vaccination card
     (H1=1), however none of the vaccinations were given (H2-H9=0).

10.  There are 5 children whose dates of vaccinations were reported
     previously to the month of birth of the child.

11.  There are 13 children with either the weight (HW2) or height
     (HW3) missing, however they were reported as measured
     (HW13=0).

12.  Children under 24 were supposed to be measured lying and 24 or
     over standing.  There are 125 children where this condition
     was not met.

13.  There are 539 children where there is an inconsistency between
     the BCG vaccination (H2) and the BCG scar observed by the
     interviewer (HW14).

14.  There are 70 cases of inconsistency between age at first sex
     (V525) and the age at first birth (V212).  In most of these
     cases the difference is only of one year.  

15.  There are 134 cases where there are inconsistencies between
     sex in the last four weeks (V526) and time since last (V527)
     sex. 

16.  There are 4 cases with zero or negative duration of interview
     (V803).  In 28 other cases the duration was more than 180
     minutes and there was only one visit (V804) to complete the
     interview.

17.  There are 50 cases where V215 exceeds the interval since last
     birth.

18.  There are 230 cases where the vaccinations were given less
     than 7 days apart of the previous one.                        Occupation Codes
